KDK-METS-SCHEMAS
================

This repository is currently used in `National Digital Library <http://www.kdk.fi/en/>`_ and `Open Science and Research Initiative <http://openscience.fi/frontpage>`_ for metadata validation in digital preservation services. Kdk-mets-schemas is a collection of XML schema catalog and schmematron files which together can be used to validate all metadata combined in METS document against the national specifications.

The current catalog version is 1.6.0. The same catalog can be used also with older specifications, starting from version 1.4.

-------------------

USAGE
-----

We have utilized xmllint commandline tool for XML schema validation.
Use the following commands to validate a METS document:

::

  export SGML_CATALOG_FILES=/<base path>/kdk_mets_catalog/catalog-local.xml
  xmllint --valid --huge --noout --catalogs --schema  ./kdk_mets_catalog/mets/mets.xsd <METS document>

For further information, see: http://xmlsoft.org/xmllint.html.

Schematron validation is done using xsltproc for XSLT conversions. EXSLT extensions are required, see http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/EXSLT/. Additionally, Schematron XSLT conversion files are also required to make conversions, see the files in https://github.com/Schematron/schematron/tree/master/trunk/schematron/code. 

Use the following commands to compile schematron files:

::

  xsltproc -o tempfile1 iso_dsdl_include.xsl ./kdk_schematron/<schematron schema>.sch
  xsltproc -o tempfile2 iso_abstract_expand.xsl tempfile1
  xsltproc -o <new compiled xsl>.xsl iso_svrl_for_xslt1.xsl tempfile2

Use the following command to validate a METS document.

::

  xsltproc -o outputfile <new compiled xsl>.xsl <METS document>

If all steps return 0 and no "<svrl:failed-assert>" elements are produced to stdout, validation is succesful. These steps have to be repeated for all schematron schemas.

For further information, see: http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc2.html, http://www.schematron.com/ and http://exslt.org/
