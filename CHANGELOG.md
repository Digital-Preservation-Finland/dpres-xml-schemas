   - AVC files from video/mp4 to video/h264.

  containers).
- Code cleanups.
- Version 0.40 is the same as 0.39 due to a tagging error.

## [0.38]

## [0.37]

## [0.36]

- Update schema and schematron files to support specifications 1.7.5.
- Add support for EAC-CPF 2.0 metadata format and fix minor bugs related to
  EAC-CPF checks (disallowing to use EAC format e.g. as provenance metadata).
- Update pronom codes of supported file formats. The codes were updated for
  the following formats: IFC, DNG, GEOPACKAGE, KML, SIARD
- The rules for checking that MDTYPE and the contained namespace match were
  previously coded differently for different specification versions. This is
  now simplified and done in the same way regardless of the specification
  version. The supported values for MDTYPE and MDTYPEVERSION have still been
  kept as specification dependent.
- There was a bug in catalog version 1.5.0 with handling rightsStatement
  element in PREMIS metadata. This bug was kept only for that version to keep
  backwards compatibility. Since it is against the official PREMIS
  specification and (according to our knowledge) not used by anyone, the
  exceptional handling for catalog version 1.5.0. is now removed.

  required for the streams where the container file is marked for bit-level
  preservation.
