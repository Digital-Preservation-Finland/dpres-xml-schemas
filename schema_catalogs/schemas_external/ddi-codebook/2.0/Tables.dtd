<!-- EXCHANGE TABLE MODEL DECLARATION MODULE -->
<!-- This set of declarations defines the Exchange Table Model as of the
          date shown in the Formal Public Identifier (FPI) for this entity.
     This set of declarations may be referred to using a public external
     entity declaration and reference as shown in the following two lines:
<!ENTITY % calstbls PUBLIC "-//SGML Open//DTD Exchange Table Model 19960430//EN">
%calstbls;
     If various parameter entities used within this set of declarations
     are to be given non-default values, the appropriate declarations
     should be given before calling in this package (i.e., before the
     "%calstbls;" reference).
     NOTE:  This set of declarations assumes a NAMELEN of 32 as is used in
     the standard CALS defined SGML declaration.
-->
<!-- This entity includes a set of element and attribute declarations
          that partially defines the Exchange table model.  However, the model
     is not well-defined without the accompanying natural language
     description of the semantics (meanings) of these various elements,
     attributes, and attribute values.  The semantic writeup, also available
     from SGML Open, should be used in conjunction with this entity.
-->
<!-- In order to use the Exchange table model, various parameter entity
          declarations are required.  A brief description is as follows:

     This set of declarations will use the default definitions shown below
     for any of these parameter entities that are not declared before this 
     set of declarations is referenced.
-->
<!-- These definitions are not directly related to the table model, but are 
          used in the default CALS table model and may be defined elsewhere (and 
     prior to the inclusion of this table module) in the referencing DTD. -->
<!ENTITY % bodyatt "">
<!ENTITY % yesorno 'CDATA'>
<!-- no if zero(s), yes if any other digits value -->
<!-- yesorno changed to CDATA from NUMBER by Jerome McDonough, -->
<!-- Library Systems Office, U.C. Berkeley, for XML compatibility. -->
<!ENTITY % titles 'titl?'>
<!ENTITY % paracon '#PCDATA'>
<!-- default for use in entry content -->
<!--
     The parameter entities as defined below change and simplify the CALS table 
model as published (as part of the Example DTD) in MIL-HDBK-28001.  The
resulting simplified DTD has support from the SGML Open vendors and is
therefore more interoperable among different systems.
These following declarations provide the Exchange default definitions
for these entities.  However, these entities can be redefined (by giving 
the appropriate parameter entity declaration(s) prior to the reference 
to this Table Model declaration set entity) to fit the needs of the 
current application.
Note, however, that changes may have significant effect on the ability to
interchange table information.  These changes may manifest themselves
in useability, presentation, and possible structure information degradation.
